This program is made for YuGiOh but plans for adapting it for multiple trading card games may in the future.

This programs purpose is to simulate first hand draws of a deck to gauge the decks consistency.
The following are the notes I have taken down while thinking of the functions of what the program will do going forward:

take a standardized list of cards and turn it into a list of integers ranging from 1 to 40-60
list out the names of the cards back to the user and add the integers to the start of the names without dupes
have the user type a list of numbers that are required in an open hand to be viable
be able to put multiple numbers in one entry for combos
ask if the prefference is to go first or second turn
ask if it is required for them to go on given turn
have the program get one extra card on turn two play

have the program randomly draw hands on and give 50/50 on starting first or second on each hand drawn
if hand is not considered viable, have the program draw cards until it is considered viable and record how many draws it took
have the program do this 1000 times
give statistics on results at the end

stat on how many first hands were viable right away
stat on how many usable cards/combos where in hand on first hand
stat on if the first hand were not viable and how many draws it took to become viable
